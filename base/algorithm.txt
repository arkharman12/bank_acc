	      1.Inside this BankingApplication class, create all the necessary variables for the program. For example, options, amount, extraMoney and exit.
	      2.Make a new do while loop.
	      3.Inside the loop, make switch statements that will be responsible for running this program.
	      4.Calculate all the interest rates for different kinds of accounts and add them to the user account depending on how frequently the account gets an interest rate.
