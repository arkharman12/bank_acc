					                  Banking ATM Algorithm

•Goals - The main goal of this program is to create a simple banking ATM in Java. 

•Input - The programs will receive a lot of inputs from the user according to what they are trying to do with the banking system program.

•Output - Outputs will depend on what user have entered in the program but mostly it will be something related to their account they have opened. For example, account balance etc.

•Steps - class BankingAtm{}:
	1.Inside this BankingApplication class, create all the necessary variables for the program. For example, accNumber, name, and balance.
	2.Declare a Scanner KB which will be responsible for storing the user input in appropriate variable.
	3.Make a method to open an account.
	4.Make a method to display all the user accounts’ details.
	5.Make a method to deposit money into the account(s).
	6.Make a method to withdraw money from accounts(s).
	7.Implement a boolean system that will help us look up user’s account by account number.

class BankApp{}:
	1.Create initial accounts for the ATM.
	2.Make a do while loop.
	3.Inside that do while loop, make a menu system. This is how user will navigate inside the program.
	4.Make switch statements that will be responsible for running this program based on the user input.
	5.Finally implement the exit command. So, the user can exit if they are done with whatever they were doing.
